LabTeams is an organizational model for LabDAO that allows any member to launch a virtual laboratory (a "web-lab") within the LabDAO community. 

LabTeams allow members to self-organize in a structure that meets their needs and lets them focus on the topics they want to work on. Labs within LabDAO can be focused on both scientific fields (proteomics, representation learning) and operational tasks (graphic design). 

## What do Labs look like? 
Labs can come in several different forms, with the naming convention always being 'Topic Lab' (e.g. protein engineering lab, or webdesign lab). 

Generally labs are designed to be the home for 
**scientists**, **inventors** and **entrepreneurs** to come together and meet new labmates with similar interests and goals. 

Teams can also fulfill core operational roles within LabDAO, with groups emerging from current working groups such as a UX lab, a tokenomics lab etc. The current working groups (technology, community, coordinatiabTeams?
