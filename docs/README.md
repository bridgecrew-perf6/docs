## contributing
We follow an [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principle and encourage documenting functions and processes within their most relevant context (for example, within the dedicated github repository of an application).

When contributing to any LabDAO or LabDAO-affiliated repository you agree to our contributor guidelines.
