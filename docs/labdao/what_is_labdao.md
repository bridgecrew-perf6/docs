# What is LabDAO?
LabDAO is a global online community of scientists and engineers that come together to develop and share open tools for life science research. The community's mission is to accelerate progress in the life sciences by making both computational and wet-lab tools accessible to all its members.

Members within LabDAO implement algorithms and laboratory processes to offer them to community members on a peer-to-peer exchange, openlab. 

Right now the community is focused on sharing access to ressource intensive bio-computation. We plan to onboard wet-lab processes soon.
