# Get involved
There are multiple ways to get involved within LabDAO. Below we list the most important areas of focus within the community, the tools we use and how to get started. 

## Working groups
The community is organized in three working groups
* Technology working group - infrastructure, contract and scientific application development
* Community working group - communications, onboarding and community building
* Coordination working group - mechanism design, token economics and legal questions

## Tools used within the DAO
Within the DAO we coordinate around a set of core tools: 
* GitHub - to track contributions and establish a shared truth
* Discord - for instant messaging and community announcements
* Coordinape - for tracking contributions to the project in a peer-to-peer fasion

## Getting started
Welcome to LabDAO! This is a simple process on how to become a meaningful contributor to LabDAO and the projects it is working on: 

1. join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/labdao)  and introduce yourself in the introductions channel.
2. fill out the [onboarding form](https://forms.gle/N4e8gC3DjuZCaNU89) and make sure to submit your Github account. Even if you do not write code, having a Github account is going to be very important to perform tasks, get mentioned in issues and interact with the rest of the community.
3. find your team: assign yourself a role on Discord for one our three working groups, if you havenâ€™t done so. Depending on your special interests and skills, check out the  section in the discord - this is where people with a specific interest gather (for example, protein engineering, nextflow). 
4. join one of our calls, visible on our [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y192djc3YWY1ZWQ0OGZmdGRhMGZ0N2piYW1pMEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t)
5. jump right in, connect with co-contributors in the discord sub-channels and contribute via [Github](https://www.notion.so/Github-c7a1b2eaa68948a9872b6a5b467b8fcf) 

## Joining and initiating a project
The DAO is organised in teams. If you have a project idea for a new project or want to join an existing team, head over to [Projects for Contributors](https://www.notion.so/Projects-for-Contributors-1f3a4bbe147e485faeab4eafdbca56cc) to see what we are currently working on.
Within each project, contributors work together on Github by contributing their work to repositories and opening issues to discuss changes.
