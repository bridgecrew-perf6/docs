# docs
Want to get started contributing to LabDAO? - this is a good place to start!

We follow an [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principle and encourage documenting functions and processes within their most relevant context (for example, within the dedicated github repository of an application).
